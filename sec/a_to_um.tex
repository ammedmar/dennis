\section{From $\cA$ to $\UM$}

Let us record the following observation.
If $\cA$ denoted the usual (associahedral) minimal resolution of the associative (non-symmetric) operad.
Then there is a quasi-isomorphism to the planar part of the operad $\UM$ defining an operad map given recursively by sending the $r$-corolla to the element obtained by applying the basic chain homotopy to the boundary of the corolla, given by all its splitting into the composition of two corollas.
Although the correct chain homotopy in general is a sum of the form $h + ihp + \dots + i^rhp^r$, we notice that the action of $p$ on said boundary is $0$ using an induction argument.

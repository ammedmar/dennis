There is a tense trade-off in topology having roots reaching back to the beginning of its modern form.
This tension can be illustrated with the concept of cohomology.
The first approaches, dating back to Poincar\'e, are based on the idea of subdividing a space into simple contractible pieces.
These elementary shapes generate a free graded module and their spatial relations define the differential used to compute cohomology.
This definition makes certain geometric properties of cohomology, for example excision, fairly clear.
Yet, it is not easy to show that a continuous map of spaces induces a map between their associated cohomologies.
The functoriality just alluded to is trivial when defining cohomology in terms of homotopy classes of maps to Eilenberg--MacLane spaces, but this passage to the homotopy category forgets much geometric information and it is not easy to concretely manipulate on specific examples.

The cohomology of spaces as a graded group is a fairly computable invariant but it has noticeable limitations.
For example, the spaces $\mathbb{C} P^2$ and $S^2 \vee S^4$ have isomorphic cohomology groups, which can be distinguished considering cohomology as a natural graded commutative ring.
In the spectral context, this finer structure is defined through the wedge product of Eilenberg--MacLane spaces, whereas in the cellular model it follows from a choice of chain approximation to the diagonal, i.e., a natural chain map
\[
\gchains(X) \to \gchains(X) \ot \gchains(X)
\]
inducing a isomorphism when $X$ is a point.
In this survey article we will overview, from a viewpoint that emphasizes their constructive nature, some algebraic structures that arise from such chain diagonals and the homotopical information they encode.

Our first goal will be to study chain approximations to the diagonal with rational coefficients.
Over this field, a chain approximation to the diagonal can be chosen so that the permutational symmetries of the diagonal are preserved, resulting in a cocommutative coalgebra.
This coalgebra cannot simultaneously be made coassociative, but
this relation can be imposed in derive sense through a family of coherent chain homotopies which also respect certain symmetry constrains and give rise to a so called $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure.
Through Koszul duality, this structure is equivalent to a differential on the completion of the free Lie algebra generated by the cells shifted in degree by $1$.
For cell complexes whose closed cells have the $\Q$-homology of a point, Dennis provided a local inductive construction defining such a structure \cite{sullivan2007appendix}.
As proven by Quillen, the quasi-isomorphism type of this $C_\infty$-coalgebra is a complete invariant of the rational homotopy type of simply-connected finite-type spaces.
To generalize Quillen's equivalence of homotopy categories to one between (not necessarily 1-connected) simplicial sets and complete dg Lie algebras, the authors of \cite{buijs2020liemodels} extended non\-/constructively the work of Dennis and Ruth Lawrence \cite{lawrence2014interval} by building a natural $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the chains of standard simplices.
The Lawrence-Sullivan $C_\infty$-coalgebra on the chains of the interval $\gchains(\gcube)$ is given via an explicit formula with much geometric content.
The explicit nature of which has only been achieved for simplices of dimension less than or equal to $4$.

$C_\infty$-coalgebras are controlled by the operad $\com_\infty$ which is the minimal resolution over the rationals of the operad $\com$ controlling cocommutative and coassociative coalgebras.
Another resolution of interest is constructed concatenating the bar and cobar construction on $\com$.
As Dennis and Scott Wilson considered, this resolution can be described using rooted trees with vertices colored black or white.
In \cite{bibid}, Daniel Robert-Nicoud and Bruno Vallette studied coalgebras over this resolution which they termed $CC_\infty$-coalgebras.
They constructed on the chain of standard simplices natural $CC_\infty$-coalgebra structures generalizing the Lawrence-Sullivan $C_\infty$-coalgebra on $\gchains(\gcube)$. These coalgebras can be explicitly described using bicolored trees.

The question of generalizing to simplicial or cubical chains the Lawrence-Sullivan $C_\infty$-coalgebra explicitly and minimally remains open.
One possible avenue is to define the tensor product of $C_\infty$-coalgebras and extend monoidally the structure on $\gchains(\gcube)$ to all cubes via the isomorphism $\chains(\cube^n) \cong \gchains(\gcube)^{\ot n}$.
Recall that $C_\infty$-coalgebras are special cases of $A_\infty$-coalgebras.
The monoidal structure on the category of $A_\infty$-coalgebras is defined through a chain approximation to the diagonal of the Stasheff polytopes which is compatible with the operad structure.
Unfortunately, the resulting $A_\infty$-coalgebra on $\gchains(\gcube)^{\ot 2}$ is not $C_\infty$.
Either through an algebraic symmetrization of the associahedral diagonal or through the construction of a family of polytopes controlling $C_\infty$-coalgebras this could be corrected, but we do not pursue this here.

Our next goal will be to study chain approximations to the diagonal map over $\Z$ and $\Fp$.
In contrast to the situation over $\Q$, chain approximations to the diagonal over these coefficients cannot be taken to be symmetric with respect to the transposition of factors, and the resulting coalgebras can be made to be only cocommutative and coassociative up to coherent homotopies, that is to say, provided with the structure of an $E_\infty$-coalgebra.
More precisely, these are coalgebras over a resolution of the operad $\com$ over these coefficients.

The study of $E_\infty$-structures has a long history, where (co)homology operations \cite{steenrod1962cohomology, may1970general}, the recognition of infinite loop spaces \cite{boardman1973homotopy, may1972geometry}, and the complete algebraic representation of the $p$-adic homotopy category \cite{mandell2001padic} are key milestones.
In this survey we will focus on the first of these areas.

Steenrod was the first to introduce homotopy coherent corrections to the broken symmetry of a chain approximation to the diagonal \cite{steenrod1947products}.
He did so on simplicial chains over $\Z$ in the form of explicit formulas defining his cup-$i$ coproducts, with \mbox{cup-$0$} the Alexander--Whitney chain approximation to the diagonal.
These coproducts are used to define Steenrod's mod $2$ cohomology operations and to effectively compute them in specific examples.

Explicitly defined $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on simplicial chains were introduced by McClure--Smith \cite{mcclure2003multivariable} and Berger--Fresse \cite{berger2004combinatorial} after the so-called ``renaissance'' of operads started in the 1990's.
It turns out that this structure can be describe solely in terms of the Alexander--Whitney diagonal, the augmentation map and a chain version of the join of simplices \cite{medina2020prop1}.
This point of view can be abstracted using the language of props, which allows it be applicable in other contexts.
We will review the resulting model of the $E_\infty$-operad, its action on simplicial and cubical chains, and generalizations of the cup-$i$ coproducts to higher arities \cite{medina2020maysteenrod}.

\section{$\pdfEinfty$-coalgebras} \label{s:integrally}

In this section we consider extensions of the Alexander--Whitney and Serre coalgebras on simplicial and cubical chains respectively.
We recall Steenrod's cup-$i$ coproducts and their induced square operations on mod 2 cohomology.
We then describe an extension of these coproducts as a full $E_\infty$-coalgebra using three linear maps, and identify generalizations to cup-$(p,i)$ coproducts inducing Steenrod operations on mod $p$ cohomology.
We close this section overviewing the use of cochain level structures in the study of symmetry protected topological phases.

\subsection{Alexander--Whitney coalgebra} \label{ss:aw diagonal}

The first chain approximation to the diagonal was given in the simplicial context by \v{C}ech and Whitney building on independent work presented during the 1935 International Congress in Moscow by Alexander and Kolmogorov.
The original references are \cite{alexander1936ring, cech1936multiplication, whitney1938products} and a historical account is presented by Whitney in \cite[p.110]{whitney1988history}.
This chain map, referred to as the \textit{Alexander--Whitney coproduct}, is defined on elements of the canonical basis by the formula
\begin{equation} \label{e:alexander-whitney coalgebra}
\copr \big( [0,\dots,n] \big) = \sum_{i=0}^n \ [0, \dots, i] \ot [i, \dots, n].
\end{equation}
Together with the \textit{augmentation map}
\begin{equation} \label{e:augmentation map}
\aug \big( [0,\dots,n] \big) =
\begin{cases}
1 & n=0, \\ 0 & n=1,
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
the Alexander--Whitney coproduct satisfies
\begin{gather}
\label{e:coassociativity relation}
(\copr \ot \, \id) \circ \copr = (\id \ot \copr) \circ \copr, \\
\label{e:counital relation}
(\aug \ot \, \id) \circ \copr = \id = (\id \ot \aug) \circ \copr,
\end{gather}
making the chains of any simplicial set $X$ into a natural coassociative counital coalgebra, referred to as the \textit{Alexander--Whitney coalgebra} of $X$.

We will use the following recursively defined notation for general coalgebras:
\begin{align*}
\copr^1 &= \copr, \\
\copr^k &= (\copr \ot \, \id) \circ \copr^{k-1}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{The join product}

The \textit{join product} $\ast \colon \chains(\simplex^n)^{\ot 2} \to \chains(\simplex^n)$ is the natural degree~$1$ linear map defined by
\begin{multline}
\ast \big(\left[v_0, \dots, v_p \right] \ot \left[v_{p+1}, \dots, v_q\right]\big) = \\
\begin{cases} (-1)^{p} \sign(\pi) \left[v_{\pi(0)}, \dots, v_{\pi(q)}\right] & \text{ if } v_i \neq v_j \text{ for } i \neq j, \\
\hfil 0 & \text{ if not}, \end{cases}
\end{multline}
where $\pi$ is the permutation that orders the vertices.
It is an algebraic version of the usual join of faces in a simplex, please consult \cref{f:join of faces} for an example.

\begin{figure}
	\input{aux/join}
	\caption{Geometric representation of the join product of two basis elements. It depicts the identity $\pr \big( [0] \otimes [1,2] \big) = [0,1,2]$.}
	\label{f:join of faces}
\end{figure}

The join product can be used in conjunction with the Alexander--Whitney coproduct to canonically construct boundaries in the chain complexes
\[
\Hom \big( \chains(\simplex^n)^{\ot s}, \chains(\simplex^n)^{\ot r} \big).
\]
For example,
\[
H = (f \ast g) \circ \copr
\]
is a chain homotopy between any two quasi-isomorphisms $g, f \colon \chains(\simplex^n) \to \chains(\simplex^n)$.
To see this, recall the augmentation map $\aug \colon \chains(\simplex^n) \to \k$ defined in \eqref{e:augmentation map} which is the counit of $\copr$, and notice that the join is a chain homotopy between $\aug \ot \, \id$ and $\id \ot \aug$, that is to say
\begin{equation}
\partial \pr = \aug \ot \, \id - \id \ot \aug.
\end{equation}
Since $f$ and $g$ are quasi-isomorphisms we have $\aug \circ f = \aug \circ g = \aug$, so
\begin{align*}
\bd H &=
\big( \aug \ot \, \id - \id \ot \aug \big) \circ (f \ot g) \circ \copr \\ &=
\big(\aug \ot \, g - f \ot \aug \big) \circ \copr \\ &= g - f.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Steenrod cup-$i$ coproduct structure} \label{ss:cup-i}

As it can be seen directly from \eqref{e:alexander-whitney coalgebra}, the Alexander--Whitney coproduct is not cocommutative.
In \cite{steenrod1947products}, Steenrod introduced coherent higher diagonals correcting homologically this lack of cocommutativity.
He used them to define the celebrated square operations, finer invariants on the mod~2 cohomology of spaces (\cref{ss:steenrod squares}).
In this subsection we present an explicit recursive definition of Steenrod's higher diagonals.

Let $C$ be a chain complex of $\Z$-modules and regard $\Hom(C, C \ot C)$ as a chain complex of $\Z[\Sym_2]$-modules where $\Sym_2$ acts by permuting the factors in the target.
Denote the elements $1 + (12)$ and $(12) - 1$ in $\Z[\Sym_2]$ by $N$ and $T$ respectively.
A \textit{cup-$i$ coproduct structure} on $C$ is an equivariant chain map
$\cW(2) \to \Hom(C, C \ot C)$ where
\begin{equation} \label{e:minimal resolution r=2}
\begin{tikzcd} [column sep = .5cm]
\mathcal W(2) = \Z[\Sym_2]\{e_0\} & \arrow[l, "\,T"'] \Z[\Sym_2]\{e_1\} & \arrow[l, "\,N"'] \Z[\Sym_2]\{e_2\} & \arrow[l, "\,T"'] \cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
is the minimal free resolution of $\Z$ as a $\Z[\Sym_2]$-module.
The image of $e_i$ is denoted by $\copr_i \colon C \to C \otimes C$ and is referred to as the \textit{cup-$i$ coproduct} of $C$ (with respect to the given cup-$i$ coproduct structure).

We can use the Alexander--Whitney coproduct and the join product to give a recursive description of the natural cup-$i$ coproduct structure on simplicial chains introduced in \cite[p.293]{steenrod1947products}:
\begin{equation} \label{e:cup-i coproducts}
\begin{split}
& \copr_0 = \copr, \\
& \copr_i =
(\ast \ot \id) \circ (\id \ot (12)\copr_{i-1}) \circ \copr.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We refer to \cite{mcclure2003multivariable, gonzalez-diaz1999steenrod, medina2021fast_sq} for alternative descriptions of isomorphic \mbox{cup-$i$} constructions, where we say that two \mbox{cup-$i$} constructions on $C$, say $\psi$ and $\psi^\prime$, are \textit{isomorphic} if there is an automorphism of $\cW(2)$ making the following diagram commute:
\[
\begin{tikzcd} [column sep = -25, row sep=normal]
\cW(2) \arrow[rr, "\cong"] \arrow[rd, in=150, out=-90, "\psi^{\phantom{\prime}}"', near start] & & \cW(2) \arrow[ld, in=30, out=-90, "\psi^\prime", near start] \\
& \Hom(C, C^{\ot 2}). &
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The cup-$i$ products of Steenrod seem to be combinatorially fundamental, for example, they induce the nerve of strict infinity categories \cite{street1987orientals, medina2020globular} and can be axiomatically characterized \cite{medina2022axiomatic}.

\subsection{Steenrod square operations} \label{ss:steenrod squares}

Let $C$ be equipped with a cup-$i$ coproduct structure.
The \textit{Steenrod square operations}
\[
Sq^k \colon \rH(C^\vee) \to \rH(C^\vee)
\]
on the homology of its dual chain complex $C^\vee = \Hom(C, \Ftwo)$ are defined for every integer $k$ by the formula
\begin{equation} \label{e:steenrod squares}
Sq^k \big( [\alpha] \big) = \big[ (\alpha \ot \alpha) \copr_{k - \bars{\alpha}}(-) \big]
\end{equation}
where brackets are used to denote represented elements in $\rH(C^\vee)$.


\subsection{An $\pdfEinfty$-coalgebra on simplicial chains} \label{ss:e-infty generalization}

Cup-$i$ coproducts on simplicial chains are part of an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure.
This is a natural coalgebra structure over an operad whose arity $r$ part is a chain complex of free $\k[\Sym_r]$-module with the $\k$-homology of a point.
Similar to Dennis' construction over $\Q$ of an $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure on cellular chains (\cref{ss:dennis construction}), the existence of an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure over any coefficient ring can be guaranteed using an acyclic carrier argument \cite{eilenberg1953acyclic}.
The goal of this subsection is to describe explicitly an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on simplicial integral chains generalizing the construction of cup-$i$ coproducts of Steenrod (\cref{ss:cup-i}).

The collection of all linear maps $\chains(\simplex^n) \to \chains(\simplex^n)^{\ot r}$ for any $r$ that can be expressed as an arbitrary compositions of the Alexander--Whitney coproduct, the join product, and permutations of factors defines an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the chains of standard simplices.
We remark that, since we are only considering maps whose domain is $\chains(\simplex^n)$, the join is not part of this structure, although it is used in its construction.

The $E_\infty$-operad $\UMed$ defining this structure can be abstracted from this example.
Roughly speaking, $\UMed = \{\Med(1,r)\}_{r \geq 0}$ is the operad associated to the prop $\Med$ generated by symbols $\copr, \aug, \pr$ in biarities $(1,2)$, $(1,0)$, and $(2,1)$ of degree $0,0,1$ with $\bd \copr = 0$, $\bd \aug = 0$, and $\bd \pr = \aug \ot \, \id - \id \ot \aug$, modulo the relations $(\aug \ot \, \id) \circ \copr = \id = (\id \ot \aug) \circ \copr$ and $\aug \circ \, \ast = 0$.
In \cref{ss:homology of M} we review a family of explicit chain contractions that can be used to compute the homology of $\UMed$.
We use this family in \cref{ss:higher cup-i coproducts} to define cup-$(r,i)$ coproducts responsible for Steenrod operations at all primes.

Full details regarding the construction of the prop $\UMed$ can be found in \cite{medina2020prop1, medina2021prop2} together with a comparison to the surjection operad \cite{mcclure2003multivariable, berger2004combinatorial}, a construction based on an earlier generalization of Steenrod's cup-$i$ coproducts \cite[\S4.5]{benson1998representations}.

\subsection{Monoidal extension and cubical chains}

Let us consider the cellular chains on the interval $\gchains(\gcube)$ as a counital coalgebra in the usual way:
\begin{align*}
\copr[01] &= [0] \ot [01] + [01] \ot [1], &
\copr[0]  &= [0] \ot [0], &
\copr[1]  &= [1] \ot [1] \\
\aug[01] &= 0, &
\aug[0]  &= 1, &
\aug [1]  &= 1.
\end{align*}
This structure can be extended to the chains of cubical sets using the isomorphism
\[
\chains(\cube^n) \cong \gchains(\gcube)^{\ot n}
\]
and the fact that the tensor product of counital coalgebras receives this structure canonically.
Explicitly, for $i \in \{1,2\}$ let $C_i$ be a counital coalgebra, the tensor product $C_1 \ot C_2$ is a counital coalgebra with
\begin{align} \label{e:extension of coproduct}
\copr(c_1 \ot c_2) &= (23) \big( \copr(c_1) \ot \copr(c_2) \, \big), \\
\label{e:extension of augmentation}
\aug(c_1 \ot c_2) &= \aug(c_1) \aug(c_2),
\end{align}
where $(23)$ acts by permuting the tensor factors of $C_1 \ot C_1 \ot C_2 \ot C_2$.

For any cubical set $Y$ the induced structure on its chains agrees with that considered by Serre in \cite{serre1951homologie}, and we refer to it as the \textit{Serre coalgebra} of $Y$.

We can define an $E_\infty$-coalgebra structure extending the Serre coalgebra by describing an extension to all $\chains(\cube^n)$ of the map $\ast \colon \gchains(\gcube)^{\ot 2} \to \gchains(\gcube)$ defined to be non-zero only for
\[
\ast([0] \ot [1]) = [01], \qquad
\ast([1] \ot [0]) = - [01].
\]

For $i \in \{1,2\}$ let $A_i$ be a chain complex equipped with a degree $1$ map $\pr \colon A_i^{\ot 2} \to A_i$ and a chain map $\aug \colon A_i \to \k$ such that $\aug \circ \pr = 0$ and $\partial \pr = \aug \ot \, \id - \id \ot \aug$.
The tensor product $A_1 \ot A_2$ has the same structure, explicitly defined by \eqref{e:extension of augmentation} and
\begin{equation} \label{e:extension of product}
\pr \big( (a_1 \ot a_2) \ot (a_1^\prime \ot a_2^\prime)\big) =
(\id \ot \aug \ot \ast \, + \, \pr \ot \aug \ot \, \id)(23)
\big( a_1 \ot a_2 \ot a_1^\prime \ot a_2^\prime \big)
\end{equation}
where the right-hand side can be given more explicitly by
\[
(-1)^{\bars{a_2} \bars{a_1^\prime}} \big( \aug(a_1^\prime) \, a_1 \ot \ast (a_2 \otimes a_2^\prime)  \, + \, \pr(a_1 \otimes a_1^\prime) \ot \aug(a_2) \, a_2^\prime \big).
\]

Together, formulas \eqref{e:extension of coproduct}, \eqref{e:extension of augmentation}, and \eqref{e:extension of product} induce on the tensor product of $\Med$-bialgebras the same structure.
In particular, $\chains(\cube^n) \cong \gchains(\gcube)^{\otimes n}$ is equipped with an $\Med$-bialgebra structure induced from that in the cellular chain on the interval.
From it, a standard categorical construction -- a Kan extension along the Yoneda embedding~-- provides the chains on any cubical set with the structure of an $E_\infty$-coalgebra extending the Serre coalgebra structure or, more specifically, the structure of a $\UMed$-coalgebra.

Using the monoidal structure on $\Med$-bialgebras we also have a natural $\Med$\-/bialgebra structure on any tensor product $\chains(\simplex^{n_1}) \otimes \dots \otimes \chains(\simplex^{n_k})$ which defines a natural $\UMed$-coalgebra on multisimplicial chains \cite{gugenheim1957supercomplexes, salvatore2020multisimplicial}

\subsection{Chain contractions for $\Med$} \label{ss:homology of M}

We now explicitly describe chain contractions
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\arrow[loop, distance=2em, in=195, out=165, "\sigma"'] \Med(s,r) \arrow[r, shift left=3pt, "\proj"] &
\Med(s,r-1) \arrow[l, shift left=3pt, "\incl"]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
for every $s \geq 1$ and $r \geq 0$.
In the next section we will use these to define cup-$(r, i)$ coproducts on $\UMed$-coalgebras.

Recall that $\Med$ is the prop generated by $\copr$, $\aug$, and $\pr$ modulo certain relations (\cref{ss:e-infty generalization}).
Let $\eta \in \Med(s,r)$ be a composition of generators and define
\begin{align*}
\incl(\eta) & = (\id \ot \eta) \circ \copr, \\
\proj(\eta) & = (\aug \ot \, \id^{\ot r-1}) \circ \eta, \\
\sigma(\eta) & = (\pr \ot \, \id^{r-1}) \circ (\id \otimes \eta) \circ \copr.
\end{align*}
This define a chain contraction as above, i.e. they satisfy
\[
\proj \circ \incl - \id = 0
\qquad
\incl \circ \proj - \id = \bd \sigma.
\]

Using the relations defining $\Med$ it is not hard to see that $\Med(s,0) \cong \k$, so we have an explicit chain contraction
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\arrow[loop, distance=2em, in=195, out=165, "h"'] \Med(s,r) \arrow[r, shift left=3pt, "\proj^r"] &
\k \arrow[l, shift left=3pt, "\incl^r"]
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where
\begin{equation} \label{e:big chain contraction}
h = \sigma + \incl \sigma \proj + \dots + \incl^{r} \sigma \proj^{r}.
\end{equation}
In particular, given that by construction $\UMed$ is a free $\Sym$-module, these chain contractions shows that $\UMed$ is an $E_\infty$-operad.

\subsection{Steenrod cup-$(r,i)$ products} \label{ss:higher cup-i coproducts}

To generalize the notion of cup-$i$ coproduct structure, consider the minimal free resolution of $\Z$ as a $\Z[\Cyc_r]$-module
\begin{equation} \label{e:minimal resolution r>2}
\begin{tikzcd} [column sep = .5cm]
\mathcal W(r) = \Z[\Cyc_r]\{e_0\} & \arrow[l, "\,T"'] \Z[\Cyc_r]\{e_1\} & \arrow[l, "\,N"'] \Z[\Cyc_r]\{e_2\} & \arrow[l, "\,T"'] \cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{e:trnaposition and norm maps}
N = 1 + \rho + \dots + \rho^{r-1}, \qquad
T = \rho - 1,
\end{equation}
and $\rho$ is a generator of $\Cyc_r$.

Let $C$ be a $\UMed$-coalgebra, for example the chains on a simplicial or cubical set.
For $r \geq 2$, let $\psi(r) \colon \cW(r) \to \End(C, C^{\ot r})$ be the $\Cyc_r$-equivariant chain map defined recursively by
\begin{equation}\label{e:definition of psi}
\begin{split}
\psi(r)(e_0) & = \Delta^{r-1}, \\
\psi(r)(e_{2m+1}) & = h\,T\,\psi(r)(e_{2m}), \\
\psi(r)(e_{2m}) & = h\,N\,\psi(r)(e_{2m-1}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $T$ and $N$ are explicitly defined in \eqref{e:trnaposition and norm maps} and $h$ in \eqref{e:big chain contraction}.
The \textit{Steenrod cup-}$(r, i)$ \textit{product} of $C$ is defined for every $r, i \geq 0$ as the image in $\End(C, C^{\ot r})$ of $\psi(e_i)$.
We remark that for $r = 2$ the resulting cup-$i$ coproduct structure on simplicial chains recovers Steenrod's original construction \eqref{e:cup-i coproducts}.

\subsection{Steenrod operations} \label{ss:steenrod operations}

Let $p$ be an odd prime.
We now review a construction of Steenrod operations in mod $p$ cohomology analogue to the one given in \cref{ss:steenrod squares} for Steenrod squares.
We remark that Steenrod square operations are parameterized by the mod $2$ homology of $\Cyc_2 = \Sym_2$.
As explained for example in \cite[Corollary~VI.1.4]{adem2004milgram}, an inclusion $\Cyc_p \to \Sym_p$ induces a surjection in mod $p$ homology.
Using the homological degrees where this surjection is non-zero we have the following construction explained in more detain in \cite{steenrod1952reduced, steenrod1953cyclic, steenrod1962cohomology, may1970general}.

Let $C$ be a $\UMed$-coalgebra and $C^\vee = \Hom(C, \Fp)$.
We simplify notation and denote the explicit linear map $\psi(p)(e_i) \colon C \to C^{\ot p}$ defined in \eqref{e:definition of psi} simply by $\psi_i$.
For any integer $s$, the \textit{Steenrod operations}
\begin{equation*}
P_s \colon \rH(C^\vee; \Fp) \to \rH(C^\vee; \Fp)
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\beta P_s \colon \rH(C^\vee; \Fp) \to \rH(C^\vee; \Fp)
\end{equation*}
are defined by sending the class represented by $\alpha \in C^\vee$ of degree $q$ to the classes represented respectively for $\varepsilon \in \{0,1\}$ by
\begin{equation*}
\pm \, \alpha^{\ot p} \circ \psi_{(2s-q)(p-1)-\varepsilon}(-)
\end{equation*}
where a possible sign convention is introduced and motivated in \cite[(6.1)]{steenrod1953cyclic}.

\subsection{Cartan and Adem relations}

There is a conceptual pattern producing additional homological information from relations bounding primary structure.
As an example, we have seen that Steenrod operations can be understood as structure on cohomology deduced from lifting to the cochain level the commutativity relation satisfied by the cup product.
Steenrod operations, which we now regard as primary cohomological structure, satisfy relations that lead to finer structure.
The first of these is the \textit{Cartan relation} that establishes a connection between Steenrod operations and the cup product, it is given by:
\begin{equation*}
P_s\big(\alpha \beta \big) = \sum_{i+j=s} P_i\big( \alpha \big) P_j\big( \beta \big).
\end{equation*}
The second is the \textit{Adem relation}, controlling the iteration of Steenrod operations, and given by:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $p = 2$ and $a > 2b$, then
	\begin{equation*}
	P_{a} P_{b} = \sum_i \binom{2i-a}{a-b-i-1} P_{a+b-i}P_i,
	\end{equation*}
	\item If $p > 2$ and $a > pb$, then
	\begin{equation*}
	P_{a} P_{b} = \sum_i (-1)^{a+i} \binom{pi-a}{a-(p-1)b-i-1} P_{a+b-i}P_i.
	\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
There are version of these using the $\beta P_s$ operations but we do not write them here, see for example \cite{steenrod1962cohomology, may1970general}.

Steenrod operations and the above relations are a homological consequence of an $E_\infty$-structure.
For cellular chains we have seen explicit cochain level constructions, the cup-$(p,i)$ products, inducing the Steenrod operations, and it is desirable to produce cochains enforcing these relations.
%That is to say, given one or two cocycles construct naturally  a cochain whose coboundary is equal to the difference between the compositions of cup-$(p,i)$ products applied to these cocycles that descend to the Cartan and Adem relations between their represented cohomology classes.
For the even prime case, Cartan and Adem coboundaries have been constructed effectively in \cite{medina2020cartan} and \cite{medina2021adem} respectively.
Cartan coboundaries for odd primes can be constructed with the tools already described, but the Adem relation requires additional techniques not yet available.

A source of motivation for these cochain level constructions comes from their use in the study of topological phases as we overview next.

\subsection{Symmetry protected topological phases and cochain constructions}

A central problem in physics is to define and understand the moduli ``space'' of quantum systems with a fixed set of invariants, for example their dimension and symmetry type.
In condensed matter physics, quantum systems are
presented using \textit{lattice models} which, intuitively, are given by a Hamiltonian presented as a sum of local terms on a Hilbert space associated to a lattice in $\R^n$.
We think of these as defined on flat space.
One such system is said to be \textit{gapped} if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is bounded away from $0$, and two Hamiltonians represent the same \textit{phase} if there exists a deformation between them consisting only of systems that remain bounded from below.

Given a lattice model, using cellular decompositions and state sum type constructions one can often compute the corresponding \textit{partition functions} on spacetime manifolds from actions expressed in terms of gauge fields represented by cochains and cochain level structures: Stiefel--Whitney cochains, cup-$i$ products and Cartan/Adem coboundaries, for example.
%In certain cases, more general space-time manifolds can be considered by providing them with a cellular decomposition and assembling a lattice model over it.
%The resulting \textit{partition function} is defined through a state-sum procedure whose
Subdivision invariance gives rise to a topological quantum field theory, which in the \textit{invertible} case is expected to be controlled by a generalized cohomology theory \cite{xiong2018minimalist, gaiotto2019cohomology, freed2021reflection}.
The cochain level structure used in the definition of the cellular gauge theory is interpreted from this point of view as describing a cochain model of the Postnikov tower of the relevant spectrum.
For example, fermionic phases protected by a $G$-symmetry are believed to be classified by applying to $BG$ the Pontryagin dual of spin bordism \cite{kapustin2015cobordism, kapustin2017fermionic}.
Building on these insights, A. Kapustin proposed a structural ansatz in low dimensions that Greg Brumfiel and John Morgan verified by constructing cochain models of certain connective covers of said spectrum \cite{brumfiel2016pontrjagin, brumfiel2018pontrjagin}.
The resulting models use cup-$i$ products and Adem coboundaries to represent $k$-invariants and the additive structure of the spectrum.
%We expect the finer cochain level structures overviewed in earlier sections to be useful for expanding this connection between condensed matter physics and homotopy theory.

%The interplay between condensed matter physics and combinatorial topology is passes naturally through combinatorial topology and we expect that the finer structure encoded on the diagonal approximation of cellular spaces to play a
%
%The \textit{partition function} of which, i.e. the $\mathbb{C}$-valued function on closed manifolds, is defined through a state-sum procedure after providing the manifold under consideration with a cellular decomposition and assembling the lattice model on it.
%The resulting action is expressed in terms of fields represented by cochains and cochain level structure, such as cup-$(p,i)$ products and Cartan/Adem coboundary constructions.

%Classifications of the resulting TQFTs have been proposed for certain type of phases in terms of spectra.
%The cochain level structure alluded to before is interpreted as encoding the Posnikov tower of the relevant spectrum.
%For example, fermionic phases in dimensions up to $4$

%We will discuss fermionic SPT phases, with their bosonic counterparts treated similarly with less complications.
%One could

%After the work of Wu-Gen, Kitaev, Gaiotto, Kapustin, Thorngren and many other \cite{gaiotto2016spin, kapustin2017fermionic, barkeshli2021classification} it is known that certain topological gauge theories can be described using as fields the cellular cochains of a manifold with values on an $\infty$-group $\mathbb G$, which can be thought of as a Postnikov tower, and employing cochain level structures, such as cup-$i$ products and Cartan/Adem coboundaries, to describe the relevant action functionals.
%Particularly important for fermionic theories are the Postnikov towers of Spin bordism and its Pontryagin dual.
%
%Following a question by Kapustin, Brumfiel and Morgan constructed cochain models of these in dimensions 3 \cite{brumfiel2016pontrjagin} and 4 \cite{brumfiel2018pontrjagin}, see also \cite{brumfiel2018quadratic}.
%As expected, the cochain description of these uses the same cochain level structures used to define the fields and action functionals consider by physicist in their models of (2+1)D and (3+1)D fermionic topological phases.

%
%These relations play an important role in the definition of secondary cohomology operations and $\kappa$-invariants of Postnikov towers.

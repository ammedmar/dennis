%the natural cup-$i$ construction introduced in the simplicial context by Steenrod can be expressed up to signs by the formula
%\begin{equation} \label{e:steenrod diagonal}
%\Delta_i(x) = \sum_U d_{U^0}(x) \otimes d_{U^1}(x)
%\end{equation}
%where $x$ is a simplex of dimension $n$ and the sum is over all sets of cardinality $n-i$ of non-negative integers less than or equal to $n$ \cite{medina2021newformulas}.

%\begin{equation} \label{e:aw diagonal}
%\Delta_0(x) = \sum_U d_{U^0}(x) \otimes d_{U^1}(x)
%\end{equation}
%where the sum is over all sets $U = \{u_1 < \dots < u_n\}$ of non-negative integers less than or equal to $n$, and for $\varepsilon \in \{0,1\}$ we write $U^\varepsilon = \{u_i \in U \mid u_i + i\cong \varepsilon \text{ mod } 2\}$ and $d_V = d_{v_1}\! \dotsm \, d_{v_k}$ for any such subset $V = \{v_1 < \dots < v_m\}$.


%\subsection{Steenrod cup-$(p,i)$ products}
%
%The Steenrod square operations described in the previous section are parameterized by the mod 2 homology of the group $\Sym_2$.
%We will know discuss homology operations parameterized by the mod $p$ homology of $\Sym_p$ introduced non\-/constructively by Steenrod in \cite{steenrod1952reduced, steenrod1953cyclic}.
%
%The mod $p$ homology of the cyclic group $\Cyc_p$ of order $p$ detects that of the symmetric group $\Sym_p$, that is to say, any inclusion $\Cyc_p \to \Sym_p$ induces a surjective map in homology with $\Fp$-coefficients, twisted by the sign representation or not.

%\subsection{Co-operads}
%
%It will also be convenient to review the notion of \textit{left} and \textit{right cooperad}.
%This is respectively a left or right $\Sym$-module with the structure of a comonad on its associated functor.
%The notions of \textit{$\cC$-coalgebra} (resp. \textit{$\cC$-algebra}) where $\cC$ is a right (resp. left) cooperad correspond to compatible collections of chain maps
%\[
%C \to \cO(r) \ot_{\Sym_r} C^{\ot r}
%\]
%and equivariant chain maps
%\[
%C^{\ot r} \to \cO(r) \ot C
%\]
%respectively.

%\subsection{Quadratic and Koszul duality}
%
%We start by recalling the duality that relates the operads $\com$ and $\lie$ as explained in \cite{ginzburg1994koszul}.
%We refer to \cite[Ch.~7,~10]{loday2012operads} for a more detailed presentation.
%
%Let $\com$ and $\lie$ be the operads controlling respectively commutative and Lie (co)algebras.
%These are examples of \textit{quadratic operads} as we describe now.
%An \textit{operadic quadratic data} is a pair $(E, R)$ consisting of an $\Sym$-module $E$ and a sub-$\Sym$-module $R$ of $\free(E)^{(2)}$, the sub-$\Sym$-module of the free operad generated by $E$ spanned by the composites of two elements.
%Let $E^\vee$ be the linear dual of $E$ regarded as an $\Sym$-module with the sign representation, and let $R^\perp$ be the annihilator of $R$ in $\free(E^\vee)(3)$.
%The \textit{quadratic dual operad} of $\free(E, R)$ is by definition the operad $\free(E^\vee, R^\perp)$ denoted $\free(E, R)^\shrik$.
%The \textit{quadratic dual co-operad} $\free(E, R)^\antishrik$ is defined similarly as $\free^\c(s E^\vee, s^2 R^\perp)$ where $s$ denotes the the suspension of $\Sym$-modules.
%
%It can be directly checked that
%\begin{align*}
%\com^\shrik &= \lie, \\
%\lie^\shrik &= \com.
%\end{align*}
%Furthermore, if $\cobar$ denotes the cobar construction of co-operads, it can be shown that the canonical maps
%\begin{align*}
%\cobar \lie^\c \cong \cobar \com^\antishrik &\to \com, \\
%\cobar \com^\c \cong \cobar \lie^\antishrik &\to \lie
%\end{align*}
%define minimal resolutions.
%We say that a general quadratically presented operad $\cO$ is \textit{Koszul} if the map $\cobar \cO^\antishrik \to \cO$ is a quasi-isomorphism.
%This implies, since $\cobar \cO^\antishrik$ is cofibrant, that $\cobar \cO^\antishrik$ is a resolution of $\cO$ or, in other words, a model for $\cO_\infty$.
%
%Given a chain complex $C$, there is a natural bijection between $\cO_\infty$-coalgebra structures on it and homological differentials with vanishing linear term on the free complete $\cO^\antishrik$-algebra generated by $C$.
%For example, $C_\infty$-coalgebras on $C$ can be identified with differentials on the completion of the free Lie algebra on $s^{-1} C$.
